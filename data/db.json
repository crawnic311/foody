Bake until fork tender. Allow the potatoes to cool to room temperature or until cool enough to handle. Cut the top of the potato and press the sides to open. Using a spoon, scoop out the inside of the potato being careful not to break the skin and place the potato in a bowl. Arrange the potato skins back on the baking sheet. Place the butter, sour cream, cheddar and chives in the bowl with the potato. Season with salt and pepper. Using a hand mixer, blend the potatoes together with the other ingredients until fluffy. Spoon the potato mixture back into the potato skins or fill a pastry bag with the filling and pipe the mixture into the shells. Top the potatoes with the remaining cheese and return to the oven. Turn the heat down to 375 degrees and bake the potatoes for 25-30 minutes. Sprinkle with chives and serve immediately."
